# The Athinkra Mwangwego Book Typeface

This repository contains the source assets for a font supporting the Mwangwego script.
The Mwangwego script in turn contains 47 symbols: 31 base syllables in "-a" (Misisi),
4 vowel changing diacritical marks (Masiri), and 12 consonant modifiers (Mituyo). 

The font was originally created by Jason Glavy in 2010 for the [Athinkra](https://www.athinkra.com/) project and distributed
under the name "Mwangwego Book".  The Athinkra project placed the font under the [OFL](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL) license in 2024,
this project updates the OFL release to relocate the glyphs into the Private Use Area.  See the [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG.txt)
file in this directory for a list of additional changes.


## Refinment Notes and TODOs

* The Emwa length is set to 1/3 the line height (needs evaluation). Ima, Otu, and Uyu are then based on this proportion.
* Increase font height to accomodate Pewa (avoid top trunctation from interlinear spacing).
* Rename glyphs to support positioning over ligatures (avoid "\_" use which FontLab interprets in a special way).
* Verify that letters heights should be the same.
* Check if "U" shapes should have the same spacing between vertical strokes.
* Add fillets to all joining positions of the the diacritics.
