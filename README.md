# The Athinkra Mwangwego Book Typeface

This repository contains the source assets for a font supporting the Mwangwego script.
The Mwangwego script in turn contains 47 symbols: 31 base syllables in "-a" (Misisi),
4 vowel changing diacritical marks (Masiri), and 12 consonant modifiers (Mituyo). 

The font was originally created by Jason Glavy in 2010 for the [Athinkra](https://www.athinkra.com/) project and distributed
under the name "Mwangwego Book".  The Athinkra project placed the font under the [OFL](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL) license in 2024,
this project updates the OFL release to relocate the glyphs into the 
[Supplementary Private Use Area-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_Private_Use_Area-A).

Beginning from the v1.700 release, the glyphs have been reencoded under the Unicode 19 provisional encoding for 
Mwangwego script:  U+16E00 - U+16E3F

See the [FONTLOG](FONTLOG-Mwangwego-Book.txt) file in this directory for a list of additional changes.

## Keyman Keyboard
An experimental [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) keyboard is available that works with the encoding of the font. 
The keyboard is available at [this link](https://keyman.com/keyboards/athinkra_mwangwego).
